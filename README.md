# note-taker
## USER STORY
### As a small business owner I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Description
### Given a note-taking application when I open the Note Taker then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page when I click on the link to the notes page then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column when I enter a new note title and the note’s text then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page when I click on the Save icon then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes when I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column then that note appears in the right-hand column when I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
